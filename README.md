This Python script encompasses three main functionalities.

Rock, Paper, Scissors Game: Users engage in the classic game against the computer by selecting "rock," "paper," or "scissors" as their choice. The program then randomly selects its choice and determines the winner based on the game's rules.

Password Generator: Users can generate random passwords by specifying the number of passwords desired and their length. The generated passwords include a mix of alphanumeric characters and special symbols for security.

Turtle Drawing: Using the Turtle module, the script creates a cartoon-like humanoid robot character. It draws various shapes and lines to depict the robot's body, arms, and eyes.

These functionalities demonstrate interactive gameplay, randomization, user input processing, and basic graphics capabilities using Python.
